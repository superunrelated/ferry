# React Component Rules

## Component Design Rules

### No className Props
**Rule**: No custom libs component should accept `className` as a prop.

**Rationale**: 
- Components in the UI library should have consistent, predefined styling
- Allowing `className` props creates inconsistency and makes components harder to maintain
- If customization is needed, use variant props or composition patterns instead

**Exceptions**: None. All UI library components must follow this rule.
